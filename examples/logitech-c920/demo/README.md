# [`uvcc`](https://joelpurra.com/projects/uvcc/) demo recording

Scripted (repeatable) demo recording showcasing `uvcc` capabilities.

- This is a development tool.
  - Requires additional software to function.
  - Does not have usage documentation.
  - The output is intended for the project `README.md`.
- Written specifically for Logitech C920.
  - Uses a mix of imported `*.json` files and direct `uvcc set`.
  - Not expected to, but might, work with other cameras.
- Rubber ducks?
  - The rubber ducks used in the (initial) demo video are used for [rubber duck debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging).
  - They are also mascots for [joelpurra's stream on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/joelpurra).
