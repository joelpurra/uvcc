# [`uvcc`](https://joelpurra.com/projects/uvcc/) usage

By default, the first detected UVC camera will be used. See [configuration](#configuration) to target a specific camera. Note that [many cameras are not UVC-compatible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_USB_video_class_devices).

```shell
uvcc --help
```

```text
uvcc: USB Video Class (UVC) device configurator for the command line (CLI). Used for webcams, camcorders, etcetera.

Commands:
  uvcc get <control>                    Get current control value.
  uvcc set <control> <value1> [value2]  Set control value(s).
  uvcc range <control>                  Get possible range (min and max) for a control.
  uvcc ranges                           Get all ranges (min and max).
  uvcc devices                          List connected UVC devices.
  uvcc controls                         List all supported controls for the camera.
  uvcc export                           Output configuration in JSON format, on stdout.
  uvcc import                           Input configuration in JSON format, from stdin.

Device selection for multi-camera setups.
  Numbers in hex (0x000) or decimal (0000) format.
  --vendor   Camera vendor id (vId).  [number] [default: 0]
  --product  Camera product id (pId).  [number] [default: 0]
  --address  Camera device address.  [number] [default: 0]

Options:
  --version  Show version number  [boolean]
  --config   Load command arguments from a JSON file.
  --verbose  Enable verbose output.  [boolean] [default: false]
  --help     Show help  [boolean]

Examples:

  Basic usage:
  uvcc controls                                    Available controls for the camera.
  uvcc set auto_white_balance_temperature 0        Turn off automatic color correction.
  uvcc set saturation 64                           Low color saturation (near grayscale).
  uvcc ranges                                      List possible control ranges.
  uvcc set absolute_zoom 200                       Zoom in.

  Automate config:
  - Not all controls can be imported.
  - Control order matters.
  uvcc export > my-uvcc-export.json                Save to file.
  cat my-uvcc-export.json | uvcc import            Load from file.

  Target a specific device:
  - Only useful for multi-camera setups.
  - For same-model cameras, also specify address.
  - Alt. use system USB settings to find devices.
  uvcc devices                                     List available cameras.
  sudo uvcc devices                                Avoid LIBUSB_ERROR_ACCESS.
  uvcc --vendor 0x46d --product 0x82d export

## Configuration

The command line arguments can optionally be provided using environment variables, implicit per-user/per-directory configuration files, or explicitly loaded from JSON files.

### Command line

```shell
# Find your UVC device, note the vendor id (vId) and product id (pId).
# The ids can be in hexadecimal (0x000) or decimal (0000) format.
# Example:
# - The vendor is Logitech (hexadecimal 0x46d, or decimal 1133).
# - The product is C920 HD Pro Webcam (hexadecimal 0x82d, or decimal 2093).
# NOTE: listing USB devices might require root (sudo) on some systems.
uvcc devices

# Use the vendor id and product id to export current configuration.
# NOTE: explicitly defining vendor/product is usually not necessary.
uvcc --vendor 0x46d --product 0x82d export
```

### Environment variables

Set `UVCC_<argument name>`.

```shell
UVCC_VERBOSE=true uvcc controls
```

### Configuration file format

Configuration files for `uvcc` are in JSON format. If you configure the same camera each time, it is convenient to put `vendor` and `product` in the configuration file.

```json
{
  "vendor": 1133,
  "product": 2093
}
```

### Implicit configuration file

You can put any command line arguments as properties in a JSON file called either `.uvccrc` or `.uvccrc.json`. The file is loaded from the same directory as `uvcc` is executed in, or the nearest parent directory where it can be found. A convenient location might be your `$HOME` directory.

### Explicit configuration file

Instead of passing command line arguments one by one, an explicit configuration file can be used. Explicitly defining a configuration file will prevent loading of the implicit configuration files.

```shell
uvcc --config <my-uvcc-config.json>
```

## Examples

See additional output examples in [./examples/](./examples/).

### Exported configuration

- Save the exported JSON data to a file as a snapshot of the current camera settings using `uvcc export > my-export.json`.
- The export format is made to be imported again using `cat my-export.json | uvcc import`.
- Note that some values are read-only, and are thus not exported.
- Note that the order of the imported values matters, as for example automatic white balance needs to be turned off before setting a custom white balance.

```shell
uvcc export
```

```json
{
  "absolute_pan_tilt": 0,
  "absolute_zoom": 100,
  "auto_exposure_mode": 8,
  "auto_exposure_priority": 1,
  "auto_focus": 1,
  "auto_white_balance_temperature": 1,
  "backlight_compensation": 0,
  "brightness": 128,
  "contrast": 128,
  "gain": 28,
  "power_line_frequency": 2,
  "saturation": 128,
  "sharpness": 128,
  "white_balance_temperature": 4675
}
```

## System-specific details

### Linux

User access to hardware devices, such as USB cameras, may be restricted by default on Linux. If, for example, `sudo uvcc devices` lists your camera but `uvcc devices` (without `sudo`) does not, then for ease-of-use you may adjust the device access level.

Below [userspace `/dev`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udev) (`udev`) is used to change the access level for a specific device model. Note that relaxing the access level in this way reduces device security.

1. Find your camera model's vendor and product id using, for example, [`lsusb`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lspci#lsusb).

   ```shell
   lsusb
   ```

   Example output for Logitech (vendor id `046d`) C920 HD Pro Webcam (product id `082d`).

   ```shell
   Bus 005 Device 013: ID 046d:082d Logitech, Inc. HD Pro Webcam C920
   ```

1. Create a new `udev` rules file for your UVC camera using your favorite text editor.

   ```shell
   sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/90-uvc-camera.rules
   ```

1. Add one line for your device by vendor and product id, replacing `046d` and `082d` with the ids for your camera.

   ```text
   SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="046d", ATTRS{idProduct}=="082d", TAG+="uaccess"
   ```

   If you have more than one camera model, just add more lines.

1. Reload the device rules files after editing, and apply the changes.

   ```shell
   sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
   sudo udevadm trigger --action='change'
   ```

1. Unplug your camera and plug it back in.
1. Try `uvcc devices` (without `sudo`) and check if your camera is listed.
